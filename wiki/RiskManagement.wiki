= 7. Risk Management Plan =

 * All risks will be documented using 4 criteria: Analysis, Probability, Seriousness and Predictability. Each analysis will be judged on a 100 point scale (the higher the number, the higher the risk). Probability will be judged on a 1-5 point scale, and will be the probability of the risk actually happening. Seriousness of the risk describes the implications that the risk would jeopardize the project, and will be judged on a 1-5 point scale. Predictability describes how well the project team would be able to predict the risk happening right before it happens, and is also on a 1-5 point scale.
|| *Risks* || ||
|| Group member gets sick || A team member becomes ill with a sickness more serious than a simple cold. <br><u>How to avoid:</u> As a group, not much.  Sicknesses happen. <br><u> Minimize the risk: </u> Have team member responsibilities overlap.  That way, if a member becomes too ill to work, there won’t be a complete section of the project that goes unworked on.||

|| Programming difficulties || A feature we want to add is difficult for us to implement. <br><u>How to avoid:</u> Read tutorials on how to code better in the Game Maker Language. <br><u>Minimize the risk:</u>  Scale back the design for the feature to a degree in which we are able to competently code. ||

|| Can't find appropriate sounds or graphics || We are unable to locate a suitable graphic or sound that we want to use for a section in the game. <br><u> How to avoid:</u>  Choose a simpler design for the game, one that won’t take extravagant graphics or unusual sounds. <br><u>Minimize the risk:</u> Find someone who is good with graphics and get them to help create them, or be prepared to create the sounds and graphics ourselves. ||

|| Game Maker does not have the functionality we need. || A needed or desired function for our game is not one that is supported my Game Maker. <br><u>How to Avoid:</u> Check the available functions within Game Maker. If the function is not directly supported, search for a Game Maker extension that provides the desired function. <br><u>Minimize the risk:</u> Do not try to implement anything too detailed, or drop the function altogether. ||
|| || <u>Analysis:</u> 24 <u>Probability:</u> 3 <u>Seriousness:</u> 2 <u>Predictability: </u>4 ||
|| 3D implementation is too difficult. || When attempting to implement 3D functionality, it proves to be too difficult for the project team. <br><u>How to Avoid:</u> Do not implement the game in 3D. The game will be developed in a top down view first, so it could be left as so. If another view is requested, an isometric view could be attempted instead. <br><u>Minimize the risk:</u> Keep the game in 2D. The 3 dimensional view is not required. ||
|| || <u>Analysis:</u> 12 <u>Probability:</u> 4 <u>Seriousness:</u> 1 <u>Predictability: </u>3 ||
|| Too ambitious requirements. || The original requirements developed by the project team are too ambitious for the amount of time given to complete the project.<br><u>How to avoid:</u> Do not make the requirements too in depth. Only plan to do what the team requires. Anything else can be an optional requirement, and will be implemented if time permits.<br><u>Minimize the Risk:</u> Discuss the requirements with the team. Keep the requirements that the game depends on to function. ||
