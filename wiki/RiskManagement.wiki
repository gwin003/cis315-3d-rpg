        a) All risks will be documented using a 10 pt severity scale, where higher numbers mean higher risk. More severe risks will be assessed first, and will be dealt with accordingly. If the risk presents a large problem to the project, the risk will be mitigated. 
        
        b) As I said before, risks will be assessed on a 10 pt scale.
        
        c) A risk plan will be made depending on the level of severity of the risk. Risks can be mitigated, transferred, accepted or avoided.
