 * Functional Features
    # Users will be able to save and reload game files.
    # As this game will be primarily one-player, there will not be a need to have an online score board. There may be a local high score list implemented on each machine. At a later stage in the project, we may also implement an achievement system where the player is rewarded once he/she completes a certain task or event.  
    # AI will be use a very basic structure. Enemy characters will move towards the hero at all times and will attack once the hero and the zombies collide. Some zombies will be laying siege to the military base, where defenders will be shooting at the zombies. 
    # At this time the game will not be developed to be playable online. Although if it seems that time is not restrictive, a multiplayer/online mode may be incorporated in the final game. The game will be designed in a top-down 2D perspective using game maker functions.

 * Non-functional
    # Security will not be an issue in our game.  The game will not be overly complicated, so performance is not a main concern either. Security will need to be addressed only in the event we choose to add online capabilities. 
    # Sounds and graphics will be made/recorded by us or downloaded from the internet. The sounds and graphics must represent the game play atmosphere.
