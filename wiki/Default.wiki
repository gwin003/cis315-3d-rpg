 a) The story or definition of the Game

   a. The world has been taken over by a plague of zombies. You are stationed at a military base in northern Texas. The colony set up there is a group of the last known survivors in the area, and you are one of the chief commanders in charge of defending the base from zombie infestation/attacks. The scientists in the colony are close to discovering a cure for the zombie plague, and need your help. In order to make the cure, they need some rare ingredients that cannot be found nearby. You are in charge of venturing out to find these ingredients and return them to the scientists before time runs out, and the colony is taken over by the zombies....
   
   b. The main characters involved in this game would be the main hero, whom the user will play as and control. Other characters in the game would include the other common non-playable characters (NPCs) who you can interact with in the military base. Enemies involved will also be zombies, some common and other boss enemies who are abnormally strong and will require more damage to kill.         
   c. As defined in part a, success will be achieved by defeating all the boss enemies and acquiring the rare ingredients that the scientists need to make the cure.
