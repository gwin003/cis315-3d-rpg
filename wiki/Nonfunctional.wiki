= 5.	Other Nonfunctional Requirements =
== 5.1	Performance Requirements ==
=== 5.1.1 Game Mechanics ===
When a zombie is hit with a bullet, the damage should be registered within a half a second.  Also, the ammo indicator should reflect the loss of ammunition within the same time frame.  The collision detection for when a zombie hits a player should react in the same time frame as well.  When a zombie enters the visible view, it should be indicated on the radar.


== 5.2	Security Requirements ==
Security is not a major concern for our game as it is predominately, if not entirely, offline and single player.

== 5.3	Software Quality Attributes ==
=== 5.3.1 Portability ===
The Game Maker environment is only viable on the Windows platform.

=== 5.3.2 Usability ===
Usability is highly important.  This is an entertainment-based software and we want it to be enjoyed by as many people as possible.
